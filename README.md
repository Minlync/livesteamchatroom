Project Title: Mobile App Chat function (Live steam video function)




One Sentence Description:

 

Makes user can use this function to face-to-face chat through video in real-time.

Project Abstract:

I am a person who studies website development and is also a UI designer. The initial intention of me to attend this class is to study some solid coding skills and prepare for my career.

 Last time, I studied the live stream and body track functions to create a video filter-like function.

 

It invoked me huge interest and makes me want to study it forward.  When I coded my initial video chat room page ( module 4) and inspiration popped up into my mind, "why don't I put it on my current App design page?  And let's see what is going on. "So, I immediately started my experiment with my idea.

In the beginning, I need to draw a sketch for my App in the Figma document because I need to identify the layout and figure out the functionality. Then, I have to decide the color scheme of my App and decide which one is the dominant color and which one is the secondary color.

Then, I start coding and adjusting the live stream video code from my initial sketch and blend my design elements into it. To make the website responsive, I have to adjust the canvas width and height into ( windowWidth, and WidowHeight for their response into the user’s device”

Then, I created a sub-page for the video page and put my video link into it. So, when users click the video icon, they will trigger the video function.

There are two windows on the page, the top one is for your button one is for another user, and the little green dot indicates the user’s online or offline.

 

Also, to improve more user experience, I also designed a pop-up box for users to accept or deny the video call invitation.  And set the accept button as the primary button with dominant blue. Visually, it can encourage users to click this button and navigate user into the video chat page.

And, I set another Set Timeout JS function to make it pop up after 3 seconds.

setTimeout(function() {

  document.getElementById('chat-box').style.display = 'block';

}, 3000); // display the chat box after 3 seconds
